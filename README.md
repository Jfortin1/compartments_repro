BioRxiv preprint manuscript: 
[Reconstructing A/B compartments as revealed by Hi-C using long-range correlations in epigenetic data](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/06/03/019000)

##### R scripts to estimate A/B compartments:

* From 450k methylation data: [compartments.R](https://github.com/kasperdanielhansen/minfi/blob/master/R/compartments.R) 

* From DNase-Seq data: [dnaseCompartments.R](https://github.com/Jfortin1/compartments_repro/blob/master/R/dnaseCompartments.R) 

##### Data: 

* [A/B compartments estimated from TCGA](https://github.com/Jfortin1/TCGA_AB_Compartments)
