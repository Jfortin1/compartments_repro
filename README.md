#### R code to generate A/B compartments from 450k methylation data:
------------

The main function is [compartments()](https://github.com/kasperdanielhansen/minfi/blob/master/R/compartments.R) and is implemented in the [minfi](https://github.com/kasperdanielhansen/minfi) package.

#### R code to preprocess and generate A/B compartments from DNase data:
