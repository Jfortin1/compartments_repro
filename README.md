[Reconstructing A/B compartments as revealed by Hi-C using long-range correlations in epigenetic data](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/06/03/019000)

##### R scripts to generate A/B compartments:

From 450k methylation data: [compartments.R](https://github.com/kasperdanielhansen/minfi/blob/master/R/compartments.R) 

From DNase-Seq data: [dnaseCompartments.R](https://github.com/Jfortin1/compartments_repro/blob/master/R/dnaseCompartments.R) 

##### A/B compartments estimated for TCGA data:
