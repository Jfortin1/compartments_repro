##### R code to generate A/B compartments from 450k methylation data: [compartments()](https://github.com/kasperdanielhansen/minfi/blob/master/R/compartments.R) 

##### R code to preprocess and generate A/B compartments from DNase-Seq data:

  The main function is [dnaseCompartments()](https://github.com/Jfortin1/compartments_repro/blob/master/R/dnaseCompartments.R) 

##### R code to preprocess and generate A/B compartments from single-cell ATAC-seq data:
